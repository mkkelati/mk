   - The improved module is already in place
   - Access it through the menu or by running `badvpn` command

2. For WebSocket Proxy:
   - The improved module is already in place
   - It will be used automatically when WebSocket connections are established

3. For SlowDNS:
   - Copy the improved module to replace the original:
     ```
     cp Modulos/slowdns_improved Modulos/slowdns
     chmod +x Modulos/slowdns
     ```

## Additional Recommendations for Ubuntu 20

1. Update system packages before installation:
   ```
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. Install additional dependencies:
   ```
   apt install -y net-tools dnsutils curl wget screen python3 python3-pip
   ```

3. Configure firewall to allow necessary ports:
   ```
   ufw allow 22/tcp
   ufw allow 80/tcp
   ufw allow 443/tcp
   ufw allow 7300/udp
   ufw allow 7200/udp
   ufw allow 7100/udp
   ufw allow 53/udp
   ```

4. For better performance, consider enabling BBR congestion control:
   ```
   echo "net.core.default_qdisc=fq" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
   echo "net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
   sysctl -p
   ```

These improvements ensure that DRAGON VPS MANAGER works effectively on Ubuntu 20 with enhanced connection modes and better overall performance.
